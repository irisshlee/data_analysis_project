# Data Analysis Project

## Objectives

- Thoroughly analyze the code of completed data analysis projects on Kaggle.
- Undertake other example projects on Kaggle and compare them with well-crafted data analysis projects.
- Conduct a data analysis project using data from a domain of personal interest.
- **Challenge:** Based on the analysis results, plan a suitable service and implement a simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product) using Java or C++ learned from coursework.

## Purpose of the Project

- **Career Aspiration:** I aim to pursue a career as a data analyst.
- **Need for Practical Experience:** I have not yet had the opportunity in my undergraduate courses to perform analyses using real-world data.
- **Leveraging Kaggle:** I will utilize Kaggle's abundant datasets to conduct my own analysis projects.
- **Skill Enhancement:** By understanding various example codes on Kaggle and analyzing multiple datasets, I intend to enhance my data analysis capabilities.
- **Personal Project:** I will challenge myself by tackling a data analysis project that aligns with my interests.
- **Service Development:** Based on the analysis results, I will plan and develop an MVP of a simple service, engaging in data-driven service planning and development.
- **Programming Practice:** This process will also allow me to practice C++ or Java, which I learned during my undergraduate studies.

## Anticipated Challenges

- **Studying Example Codes**
  - *Challenges:* Requires learning Python and understanding data analysis-related code.
- **Performing Data Analysis from Scratch**
  - *Challenges:* Significant difference between following examples and starting from a blank slate.
- **Analyzing Data in My Desired Domain**
  - *Challenges:* May require analyses beyond the formats provided on Kaggle.
- **MVP Development**
  - *Challenges:* Anticipate difficulties as I have not previously used C++ or Java in real-world projects.
